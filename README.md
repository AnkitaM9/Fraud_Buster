Fraud_Buster

About The Dataset- Using Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023 which contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

Key Features:

* id   : Unique identifier for each transaction

* V1-V28 : Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
* Amount : The transaction amount
* Class : Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

Main Theme of this project:

Perform exploratory data analysis using data science techniques in Python/Jupyter Notebook and build machine-learning models for detecting credit-card frauds.

# Features

Implements autoencoders for anomaly detection.

Handles pre-processing and feature scaling for optimal model performance.

Provides visualizations for better interpretability.

Employs evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC

# Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Standardizing numerical features.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

# Technology Stack

* Programming Language: Python

* Libraries and Frameworks:

 1) TensorFlow/Keras (for building and training autoencoders)

 2) Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics)

 3) Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

# Results

The project aims to achieve:

* High accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.

* Low false positive rates to minimize disruption to legitimate transactions.
